# 42matters Profiler SDK for Android

42matters profiler sdk (beta) delivers insights about Android users based on the apps they have. The sdk has a tiny footprint under 40k, and the integration requires only several lines of code. Thereâ€™s also no dubious permissions required other than accessing internet and networks states.

## Demo

This repo is a demo app printing the debug info from the profiler sdk. The app is built with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).

## How to integrate in your app

### Prerequisites
* Your app has a minimum sdk level of 10 (Android 2.3.3+).
* You registered your app on the https://42matters.com/profiler/, and you have its app id.
* The app's status is `ON`.

### Integrate the library

1. Download the [latest jar (1.0.1-beta)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/profiler.42matters.com/42matters-profiler-1.0.1-beta.jar)

2. Put the jar into your project and correctly reference it.

3. Configure your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` like this

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <manifest ... >
    ...
    <!-- Permissions -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

    <application ... >
    	...
    	<!-- You app id  -->
    	<meta-data
    		android:name="42:appid"
    		android:value="YOUR_APP_ID" />
    </application>

  </manifest>
  ```

    Replace **YOUR_APP_ID** with the app id you get on your app page

4. If you use proguard, add these into your `proguard-rules.pro`

  ```
  -dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**
  ```

5. Call `Profiler.getProfile(Context context)` to get the inferred profile about the user installed your app. This call returns immediately and start a background thread to fetch the profile if none is cached locally.

### Privacy

You need to provide a preference in the default shared preferences for users to opt out at any time. The default key to use is `com.core42matters.android.profiler.personalized`.
This demo also shows how to implement this in the preferences.


## What's inside a profile (1.0.1-beta)

### Gender

`profile.isMale()` and `profile.isFemale()` tells the inferred gender. It could happen both of them return `false`, when we are not confident about our prediction for example.

### Interests

`profile.getInterests()` would return a `List<String>` containing the interests of this user we predict.

## Use AdMobPlugin to decorate an ad request

You could use our `AdMobPlugin` to attach inferred profile to an AdMob ad request to increase the chance getting better targeted ads.

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  ...
  AdView adView = (AdView) findViewById(R.id.adView);
  adView.loadAd(AdMobPlugin.buildRequest(this));
  ...
}
```
Alternatively, you could use `AdMobPlugin.decorate(Context context, AdRequest.Builder builder)` to finish your request building.

Calls to `Profiler` are done within the `AdMobPlugin`, so you do not have to call them explicitly.
